  title: "About the Framework"
  first_paragraph: "<p>Every week, I’ll get at least one email from a Founder attempting to sell me on their innovative product. </p>
  <p>It makes me think of the time I started in sales. Although my Managers said I apparently had a natural talent for it, a lot of my first meetings ended up with prospects who thought the technology I was selling was “interesting” but at the moment, didn’t have the budget for it.</p>
  <p>The truth is, there’s a ton of content out there to get your first meeting - as well as a ton of lists and generalizations about what do or not to do in sales. The challenge is, I haven’t found much that’s really actionable, or designed with the founder or early-stage tech executive in mind.</p>
  <p>Over the past five years, my experience in tech sales has ranged from growing sales processes in new verticals from scratch, to closing millions in new enterprise deals with brands like Groupon, JP Morgan Chase and Staples. Over this time I’ve developed a framework that I’ve recently refined called the “Buy-in Framework” which I’ve used to train new sales reps into becoming top sellers like myself. </p>
  <p>In this free 5-day course, I’ll send you a daily email and video to take you through the exact framework I use. We’ll cover:</p>

<p>Hiring top talent, raising financing, closing a deal or even convincing someone to date you all use your natural sales skills whether you know it or not. </p>
<p>I’m sure you've been successful with many or all of these activities - but have you ever stopped to methodically break down why you got to the result you wanted? Further, have you taken the time to investigate what’s made you get to a desired outcome versus not, and how much business could you be unknowingly losing in the process? </p>
<p>After you sign up below and over a period of 5 days, I’ll walk you through a practical framework that’s backed by millions of dollars in signed deals and modern psychological principles that will get you and your team to think more methodically about sales. </p>
