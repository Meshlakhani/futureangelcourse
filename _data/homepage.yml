  title: "Behind the scenes.."
  first_paragraph: "<p>Every week, I’ll get at least one email from a Founder attempting to sell me on their innovative product. </p>
  <p>It makes me think of the time I started in sales. A lot of my first meetings ended up with prospects who thought the technology I was selling was 'interesting' but at the moment, didn’t have the budget for it. It felt horrible.</p>
  <p>Since humble beginnings, I've had the fortune of closing hundreds of deals and generating millions in revenue with brands like Groupon, JP Morgan Chase and Staples. Over the years I’ve built and trained teams to become top sellers like myself using a systematic process I’ve recently refined I call the 'Buy-in Framework': </p>
  <p><img src='https://dcavozvb40vtt.cloudfront.net/api/file/T4q97JYkRp2ItPWMRE7l'</p>
  <p>In this free 5-day course, I’ll send you a daily email to take you through this exact methodology. We’ll cover:</p>

<p>Hiring top talent, raising financing, closing a deal or even convincing someone to date you all use your natural sales skills whether you know it or not. </p>
<p>I’m sure you've been successful with many or all of these activities - but have you ever stopped to methodically break down why you got to the result you wanted? Further, have you taken the time to investigate what’s made you get to a desired outcome versus not, and how much business could you be unknowingly losing in the process? </p>
<p>After you sign up below and over a period of 5 days, I’ll walk you through a practical framework that’s backed by millions of dollars in signed deals and modern psychological principles that will get you and your team to think more methodically about sales. </p>
<p>It’s an abridged version of a $499 <a href='http://startupsalesbootcamp.com/?src=buyin-landingpage'>full-day educational program for startups</a> I just started teaching in New York City, which has started receiving some rave reviews.</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing about you wasting less time and closing more deals. See you inside. </p>

  qa:
    - question: "Can I get more background on Juliana?"
      answer: "Absolutely. Juliana Crispo is Director of Enterprise Sales at <a href='https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ghostery'>Ghostery</a> in New York City. While there, Juliana has opened up new verticals in the financial space, and worked with her team to quickly close accounts with almost half of top 25 ecommerce brands. <br> <br>Juliana has worked in a variety of sales roles at growth startups such as <a href='https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/meltwater'>Meltwater Group</a>, where she consistently ranked as a top 5 contributor out of over 600 sales people. While there, she hired, trained and managed new salespeople into top sellers. <br> <br>Juliana's background ranges from developing the sales process in new verticals from scratch, to closing millions in new business with brands like Groupon, JP Morgan Chase and Staples. She's used this experience to develop a framework to help startups more quickly develop a repeatable sales process."
    - question: "Can you tell me more about the Buy-in Framework? How hard is it to learn and apply?"
      answer: "The Buy-in Framework is a methodological process of 'buy ins' that I believe should be explicitly made and repeated in effective sales conversations. I've taught earlier versions of this framework to newly hired reps who I've trained to top performers, and believe you can use the same techniques to waste less time, close more deals as well as more quickly understand why a deal ultimiately doesn't go through.<br> <br> This course is made to give you immediate takeaways to grow your business, but will take (worthwhile) practice to ultimately master."
    - question: "I'm interested in the full-day Startup Sales Bootcamp. What does it involve and how can I sign up?"
      answer: "This free course is an abridged version inspired by 1 of the 4 workshops taught over a full day in the new Startup Sales Bootcamp. <br> <br>The next Startup Sales Bootcamp takes place March 14th in the Financial District, New York City. Space is limited to 5 companies so <a href='http://startupsalesbootcamp.com/?src=buyin-landingpage-belowfold'>sign up or get on the interest list for future programs</a>. "
