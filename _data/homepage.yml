  title: "Behind the scenes.."
  first_paragraph: "<p>Every week, I’ll get at least one email from a Founder attempting to sell me on their innovative product. </p>
  <p>It makes me think of the time I started in sales. A lot of my first meetings ended up with prospects who thought the technology I was selling was 'interesting' but at the moment, didn’t have the budget for it. It felt horrible.</p>
  <p>Since humble beginnings, I've had the fortune of closing hundreds of deals and generating millions in revenue with brands like Groupon, JP Morgan Chase and Staples. Over the years I’ve built and trained teams to become top sellers like myself using a systematic process I’ve recently refined I call the 'Buy-in Framework': </p>
