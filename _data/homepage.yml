  title: "About the Free Email Course"
  first_paragraph: "<p>Every week, I’ll get at least one email from an early-stage company Founder attempting to sell their innovative product to me. </p><p>It makes me think of the time I started in sales. Although I apparently had a natural talent for it, a lot of my first meetings ended up with prospects who thought the technology I was selling was “interesting” but at the moment, they didn’t have the budget.</p><p>The truth is, there’s a ton of content out there to get your first meeting - as well as a ton of lists and generalizations about what do or not to do in sales. The challenge is, I haven’t found much that’s really actionable, or designed with the founder or early-stage tech executive in mind.</p><p>Over the past five years, my experience in tech sales has ranged from growing sales processes in new verticals from scratch, to closing millions in new enterprise deals with brands like Groupon, JP Morgan Chase and Staples. Over this time I’ve developed a framework that I’ve recently refined called the “Buy-in Framework” which I’ve used to train new sales reps into becoming top sellers like myself. </p><p>In this free 5-day course, I’ll send you a daily email and video to take you through the exact framework I use. We’ll cover:</p>
<li><strong>Lesson 1:</strong> Solving the #1 mistake Founders make in sales and introducing the Buy-in Framework. </li>
<li><strong>Lesson 2:</strong> How to prime your prospects to buy into you and to making a decision using the Rapport and Agenda Buy-in.</li>
<li><strong>Lesson 3:</strong> How to get your buyer to see and articulate the value of your product back to you and get them to commit to making a change using the Pain and Change Buy-in.</li>
<li><strong>Lesson 4:</strong> How and when to start talking about your product and price using the Solution and Investment Buy in. </li>
<li><strong>Lesson 5:</strong> How to avoid deal breakers and shorten your sales cycle using the Process and Decision Buy in. </li>

<p>Hiring top talent, raising financing, closing a deal or even convincing someone to date you all use your natural sales skills whether you know it or not. </p>

<p>I’m sure many of you have been successful with many or all of these activities - but have you ever stopped to methodically break down why you got to the result you wanted? Further, have you taken the time to investigate what’s made you get to a desired outcome versus not, and how much business could you be unknowingly losing in the process? </p>

<p>Over the next 5 days, I’ll walk you through a practical framework that’s backed up by millions of dollars in signed deals and modern psychological principles that will start making you and your team start to think methodically about sales. </p>

<p>It’s an abridged version of a $499 educational program I’m teaching in New York City, which has already received rave reviews. </p>

[Insert review]

<p>Looking forward to hearing about you wasting less time and closing more deals. See you inside. </p>
